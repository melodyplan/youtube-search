## Introduction

Youtube search engine using the Youtube API. This is my first use of API, a lightbox and flexbox. Still content driven and minimalist as ever.

## How to Use

1. The landing page pokes a bit of fun and has just a search engine. Type in your search and let the results load on in.

2. The thumbnails come in large and easy to see, with no captions to distract. Click any thumbnail you want to watch.
